Scraped basketball reference and collected NBA player stats for the 2019-2020 season. 

Used this data to learn if players were worthy of their current salaries by calculating various statistics. I also tried to predict what a player might be worth from a statistical point of view.

Collected the data, used Basketball reference and Goldsberry Package. Scraped data for player contracts and NBA player stats per game from multiple seasons to get a better analysis and predictions.

After cleaning and processing the data, applied various machine learning algorithms and trained models on the cleaned data. Tested the models on a test set to calculate the MSE for each model. Choose a model that had the best MSE and used it to make further predictions.

Used linear regression to model the relationship between each player's salary and their game statistics to determine if they were overpaid. Also used linear regression to predict a player's next season salary based on their past salaries.
